IPFS

1. How IPFS Works?
    - When you add a file to IPFS, your file is split into smaller chunks, hashed, and given a unique fingerprint called a content identifier
    - The CID acts as a permanent record of your file as it exists at that point in time
    - When nodes look up your file, they ask their peer nodes whos storing the content referenced by the file's CID
    - When others view your file, they cache a copy, and become another provider of your content until their cache is cleared
    - A node can pint content in order to keep and provide it forever, or discard content it hasn't used in a while to save space
    - Files stored on IPFS are resistant to tampering and censorship
    - Any changes to a file dont overwrite the original, and common chunks across files can be reused
    - IPFS can find the latest version of your file using the IPNS decentralized naming system

2. What is IPFS
    - What - Interplanetary File System - peer to peer network protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system, which addressed based on content, not location

3. IPFS Course
    - Content Addressing on the Decentralized Web - Location Addressing vs Content Addressing
        - Location Addressing - Uniform Resource Locators
            - Who - Authorities
            - Problems
                - URLs indicate which authority we should go to for the data
                - Hard to verify URL provides what is indicated
                - Redundancy   
        - Content Addressing - Hashing
            - Who - everyone
            - Benefits
                - Hashs can be derived from the content of the data itself
                - Hashes are unique
                - Hashes can prevent malicious actors from deceiving us about the content of files
        - Hashing and Content Identifiers CIDs
            - Decoding Data Structures
                - Content Addressing can be used on all types of data
                - Content Identifier is a particualr form of content addressing used on the decentralized web
                - CID - contans a hash and a codec
                    - Codec - encode nad decode data in certain formats
                    - Multihash - self describing hash, tells you what type of function was used to create it
    - Merkle DAGs: Structuring Data for the Distributed Web
        - Advantages of Properly Structured Data
        - Directed Acyclic Graphs
            - Directed Graphs - each edge has some direction
                - Root- no parent, Leaf - parent
            - Acyclic Graphs - no loops in the graph
            - Directed Acyclic Graphs - directed and acyclic
        - Introducing Merkle DAGs
            - First, encode the leaf nodes of the graph, lowest level i.e. file, and give each a CID, each contains filename and content
            - Intermediate nodes contain list of CIDs that make it up, and a name, encoded and given a CID
            - Each node's CID depends on every single one of its descendants
            - A node's CID only changes in response to a change in its own data or that of its descendants
        - Merkle DAGs: Verifiability
            - An individual who retrieves data using a content address can always compute the CID
            - DAGs are recursive data structures 
            - Any node can be a root node
        - Distributability
        - Deduplication
    - libp2p
        - Why do we need LIBP2P?
            - Web 2.0 - issues with security and connectivity
            - Location Addressing vs Content Addressing
            - Networks are Complex
                - Firewalls, NAT, High Latency Networks, Reliability, Roaming, Censorship, Runtimes, Innovation is Slow, Data Privacy
        - Curernt Problem with P2P
            - Peer - a participant in a decentralized network
            - Peer-to-Peer - a decentralized network in which workloads are shared between peers
            - Reinventing the Wheel
                - Discoverability - how can two or more peers find each other and share information?
        - LIBP2P
            - Focused on process addressing i.e. finding, connecting, and authenticating any data transfer processes in the network
            - Modularity
