Hyperledger Fabric Documentation
    1. Enterprise Requirements
        a. Identifiable Participants
        b. Permissioned Networks
        c. High Transaction Throughput Performance
        d. Low Latency of Transaction Confirmation
        e. Privacy and Confidentiality of Business Transactions and Data 
    2. Idea
        a. Enterprise grade permissioned distributed ledger technology platform
        b. Open Governance
        c. Modular and Configurable
            - Pluggable ordering service
            - Pluggable membership service provider
            - Peer-To-Peer gossip service
            - Smart Contract
            - Ledger configuration
            - Endorsment and validation policies
        d. Smart Contracts with Go, Java, and Node
            - Order Execute
                - Validates and orders transactions and then propogates them to all peer nodes
                - each peer then executes the transaction sequentially
            - Execute Order Validate
                -  Exceute a transaction and check its correctness, thereby endorsing it
                - Order transactions via a pluggable consensus protocol
                - Validate transactions against an application specific endorsement policy before committing them to the ledger
        e. Permissioned
            - Permissionless = Anyone
            - Permissioned = Limited
        f. Pluggable Consensus Protocols
        g. Performance
    3. Model
        a. Assets
          - Key:Value Pairs
          - Binary or JSON form
        b. Chaincode
          - Software defining an asset or assets and the transaction instructions for modifying the assets
          - Functions execute against the ledger's current state database
        c. Ledger Features
          - Sequenced, tamper resistant record of all state transitions in the fabric
        d. Privacy
          - Separate channel to isolate and segregate transactions and ledger
          - Private data collection can segregate data in a private database, separate from the channel ledger
        e. Security & Membership Services
          - Public Key Infrastructure used to generate cryptographic certificates
        f. Consensus
          -
