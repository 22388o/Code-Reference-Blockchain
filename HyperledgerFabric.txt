        d. Smart Contracts with Go, Java, and Node
            - Order Execute
                - Validates and orders transactions and then propogates them to all peer nodes
                - each peer then executes the transaction sequentially
            - Execute Order Validate
                -  Exceute a transaction and check its correctness, thereby endorsing it
                - Order transactions via a pluggable consensus protocol
                - Validate transactions against an application specific endorsement policy before committing them to the ledger
        e. Permissioned
            - Permissionless = Anyone
            - Permissioned = Limited
        f. Pluggable Consensus Protocols
        g. Performance
    3. Model
        a. Assets
          - Key:Value Pairs
          - Binary or JSON form
        b. Chaincode
          - Software defining an asset or assets and the transaction instructions for modifying the assets
          - Functions execute against the ledger's current state database
        c. Ledger Features
          - Sequenced, tamper resistant record of all state transitions in the fabric
        d. Privacy
          - Separate channel to isolate and segregate transactions and ledger
          - Private data collection can segregate data in a private database, separate from the channel ledger
        e. Security & Membership Services
          - Public Key Infrastructure used to generate cryptographic certificates
        f. Consensus
          - Could be a specific algorithm, within a single function, like cryptographic hashing
          - In Hyperledger Fabric, consensus is achieved as a byproduct of the ongoing verification taking place during a transaction's journey from proposal to commitment
        g. Channels
           - Provide a mechanism for private communications and private data between the members of a consortium
        h. Peer Nodes
            - Network components where copies of the blockchain ledger are hosted
            - An X.509 certificate was issued by the Certificate Authority which associates P1 with organiztion R1.
            - The Peer can join channel using the Orderer, which uses the channel configuration to determine the peers permissions on this channel
         i. Smart Contract
            - Client can use smart contract to access ledger via the peer node
            - Provides a well defined set of ways by which the ledger can be queried and updated
            - First, a contract implementation has to be installed on a peer node
                - Peer node can see the implementation logic of S5
            - ONCE: Second, the smart contract interface has to be instantiated on the channel using the peer node
         j. Endorsement Policy
            - An endorsement policy is supplied at the time of instantiation of the chain code
            - It describes which organization must approve transactions before they will be accepted by other organizations onto their copy of the ledger
         k. Invoking a Smart Contract
            - Once it is installed on a Peer node and instantiated in the Channel, the chain code can be invoked by a client application
            - Invocation is done through client applications sending proposals to peers owned by the organizations specific by the smart contract endorsment policy
            - Transaction proposal serves as input to the smart contract, which generates an endoresed transaction response, which is returned by the peer node to the client application
            - Transaction response plus transaction proposal form a fully endorsed transaction 
         l. Types of Peers
            - REQUIRED: Committing Peer, every peer node, receives blocks of transaction which are subsequently validated before they are committed to the peer node's copy of the ledger as an append operation
            - REQUIRED: Endorsing Peer, every peer with a smart contract can be an endorsing peer. The smart contract on the peer must be used by a client application to generate a digitally signed transaction response.
                - Endorsement policy identifies the organizations whose peers should be endorsers
             - REQUIRED: Leader Peer, takes responsibility for distributing transactions from the Orderer to the other committing peers
             - Anchor Peer, Cross organization communication point
         m. Configurations
            - Network
                - Governs orderer behavior and permits organization to manage network resources
            - Channel
                - Governs access to the channel resources, read or write authority, etc
            - Updating
                - Adminstrator must submit a configuration transaction to change the network or channel configuration
                - Mod_Policy
         n. Ordering Service
            - Channel Level
                - Gathers endorsed applications from transactions and orders them into transaction blocks
            - Network Level
                - Management point for network resources according to the policies defined in network configuration
          o. Policy Change
            - Modification Policy
                - First class policy within a network or channel configuration that manages change
    4. Blockchain Network
        a. What is a blockchain network?
            - Technical infrastructure that provides ledger and smart contract (chaincode) services to applications
            - Smart contracts used to generate transactions which are subsequentlly distributed to every peer node in the network where they are immutably recorded on their copy of the ledger 
            - Multiple organizations come together as a consortium to form the network and their permissions are determined by a set of policies that are agreed by the consortium when the network is originally configured.
