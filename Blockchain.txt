Blockchain Fundamentals
    1. What is a Blockchain?
        a. Provides a single source of truth that is verifiable, tamper-proof and unchangeable.
        b. "A constantly growing ledger, that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place, in a secure, chronological, and immutable way."
    2. What is Bitcoin?
        a. Type of digital asset that can be bought, sold, or transferred securely.
        b. Peer-to-Peer no 3rd party involved.
        c. Bitcoin Network w/ Blockchain (Decentralized Record).
        d. Bitcoin Miners
            - Role, process and confirm transactions.
            - Use of powerful computers.
            - Mining is solving cryptographic math problems.
            - Rewarded in Bitcoin.
            - Ultimately build blocks of the blockchain, every ten minutes
            - Genesis Block January 3rd 2009
        e. Hash Functions
            - Cryptographic Hash, digital finger print
            - SHA256, Secure Hash Algorithm developed by the NSA
            - One way functions, no way to get source from Hash
            - Differs from encryption and decryption
        f. Block
            - Block Number
            - Data
            - Prev Hash
            - Cryptographic Hash
                - Four leading 0000 is valid
                - Tied to difficulty level, how difficult it is to get a hash smaller than the target
                - Difficulty level changes over time, increases every two weeks dependent on computing        power to average 10 minutes
            - Nonce
                - Number used once
                - Random number that will give valid hash
            - Mine
                - What is correct Nonce that will give you valid hash that is less than the required target?
        g. How Block Hashes work in a Blockchain
            - Any change made early in a block of the Blockchain invalidates the rest of the chain 
            - To validate new Blockchain, anyone would need 51% of computing power that allowed for ten minute solving
        h. How a distributed Blockchain works
            - A copy of the blockchain exists for each peer in the network
            - Any changes in a block that aren't validated creates a forking Blockchain
        i. Four Components of Bitcoin
            - Software 
                - defines bitcoin and how it gets transferred
                - every ten minutes issues cryptography challenge, find the nonce to make the hash valid
            - Cryptograpy - bitcoin is a cryptocurrency
            - Hardware - thousands of miner's computers running software
                - Race to find the solution to the nonce cryptography challenge, billions and trillions of combinations
                - One person solves the cryptography challenge
                - Now community has to validate the person's solution
                - If proof of work, block is valid and added to Blockchain
                - Miner earns reward of bitcoins
            - Gaming Theory - bitcoin is a game
        j. Coinbase Transaction
            - Every block has the coinbase transactions
            - Where miner receives the reward for challenge solution
            - Reward is BTC and transaction fees
    3. Key Concepts in Bitcoin
        a. Peer-to-Peer network, disintermediated, no 3rd party
        b. 
    4. Value of Blockchain
