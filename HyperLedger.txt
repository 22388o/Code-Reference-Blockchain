HyperLedger Fundamentals
    1. Hyperledger
        a. What is it?
            -Hyperledger is an Umbrella project of open source Blockchain and related tools started in Dec. 2015 by the Linux Foundation.
            - Version 1.0 released on July 11th, 2017
        b. Structure of re-usable tools
            - DLT/Frameworks
                - Hyperledger Sawtooth
                - Hyperledger Iroha
                - Hyperledger Fabric*
                - Hyperledger Burrow
            -  Tools
                - Hyperledger Cello
                - Hyperledger Composer*
                - Hyperledger Explorer
                - Hyperledger Quilt
        c. Hyperledger Fabric
            - Set of infrastructure and application building blocks
            - Practices & Guidelines for creating BC apps
        d. Summary
            - Hyperledger = BC incubator
            - Hyperledger Fabric = distributed ledger technology framework initiative
            - Hyperledger Composer = tool for creating business applications on DL
    2. Foundation
        a. Distributed Ledger Technology
            - Decentralized system for exchange of value
            - Asset, represents value that is tangible or intangible
            - Each node maintains a copy of the DL
            - Every time a transaction occurs. all DL are updated
            - Challenges
                - Maintaining consistency
                - Privacy
                - Standardization, Interperability, and Scalability
            - Hyperledger Fabric is a DLT framework addressing the above challenges
    3. Hyperledger Fabric
        a. What is Hyperledger Fabric
            - DLT for the Business
            - Public would be Ethereum or Bitcoin
        b. Important Characteristics
            - Permissioned Network
                - Restricts who can access and do what on the network
                - Requires known participants, access control lists
                - Transaction validations
            - Confidential Transactions
                - Participants in control of visibility of transactions
                - Private channels can be created with limited visibility
            - No cryptocurrency
                - No need to incentivise the network for validations
                - Participants decide the who and how of validation
            - Programmablle
                - Chaincode = Smart Contract
                - Chaincode automates the business process
