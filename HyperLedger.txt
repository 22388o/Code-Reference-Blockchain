    1. Hyperledger
        a. What is it?
            -Hyperledger is an Umbrella project of open source Blockchain and related tools started in Dec. 2015 by the Linux Foundation.
            - Version 1.0 released on July 11th, 2017
        b. Structure of re-usable tools
            - DLT/Frameworks
                - Hyperledger Sawtooth
                - Hyperledger Iroha
                - Hyperledger Fabric*
                - Hyperledger Burrow
            -  Tools
                - Hyperledger Cello
                - Hyperledger Composer*
                - Hyperledger Explorer
                - Hyperledger Quilt
        c. Hyperledger Fabric
            - Set of infrastructure and application building blocks
            - Practices & Guidelines for creating BC apps
        d. Summary
            - Hyperledger = BC incubator
            - Hyperledger Fabric = distributed ledger technology framework initiative
            - Hyperledger Composer = tool for creating business applications on DL
    2. Foundation
        a. Distributed Ledger Technology
            - Decentralized system for exchange of value
            - Asset, represents value that is tangible or intangible
