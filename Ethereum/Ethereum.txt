Ethereum Fundamentals
    1. What is Ethereum?
        a. History
            - October 31, 2008 - Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto
            - December 2013 - Ethereum Whitepape by Vitalik Buterin
            - July 30th, 2015 - Ethereum goes online
        b. Smart Contract
            - Code that lives in the Ethereum Blockchain
            - Can be communicated with using messages
            - Allows for the creation of advanced systems
        c. Ethereum Network
            - Used to transfer money and store data
            - Many different types of networks
            - Formed by one or more nodes
            - Each node is a machine running an ethereum client
            - Anyone can run a node
            - Each node can contain a full copy of the blockchain
            - Blockchain is a ledger that stores a record of every transaction that has ever taken place
        d. Connecting to the networks
            - Developer tecnology to create applications, web3.js
            - Consumer technology, Metamask and Mist Browser
        e. Metamask Chrome Extension
            - How to connect to Ethereum networks
            - Ethereum Wallet
            - Networks, access with single account
                - Main, Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby Tests 
            - Account
                - Account Address, unique identifier
                - Public Key, used for transactions
                - Private Key, used for transactions
        f. Order of Operations
            - Click on Submit w/ address
            - Address sent to BE Server
            - BE Server uses Web3 library to create a transaction object
            - BE Server sent transaction object to the network
                - Specific node, block is created, mining occurs
            - BE Server waited for transaction to be confirmed
            - BE Server sent success message back to browser
        g. Transaction Object
            - Nonce, how many times the sender has sent a transaction
            - To, address of receiving account
            - Value, amount of ether
            - gasPrice, amount of ether to pay per unit gas
            - startGas/gasLimit, units of gas this transaction can consume
            - V/R/S, cryptographic pieces of data used to generate senders account address. Generated from sender's private key
        h. Basic Blockchains
            - SHA256 Hash, crytographic identifier
            - Block
                - Number
                - Nonce, number used to try to figure out target hash
                - Data
                - Hash
                - Transaction List
                - Coinbase transaction, reward for mining, UTXO
            - Blockchain
                - Series of blocks, connected through previous hash value
            - Block Time, time to find a solution, around 10 minutes and difficulty increases to maintain average
            - Ethereum network Block Time = 15 seconds
        k. External Account
            - An account an entity owns
    2. How do we interact with Ethereum?
        a. Smart Contract
            - An account controlled by code
            - Field, description
            - Balance, amount of ether this account owns
            - Storage, data storage for this contract
            - Code, raw machine code for this contract
            - Contract accounts are specific to one network
            - Contract Source Code deployed as instances on network
        b. Solidity
            - Written in .sol files
            - Strongly typed
            - Similar to JavaScritp
            - Gotchas
            - Contract Definition -> Solidity Compiler -> Byte Code / Application Binary Interface
    3. Tooling, Deployment, Testing of Apps with Ethereum
    4. Building a multi-page app with Ethereum
