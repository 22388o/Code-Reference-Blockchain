    2. Foundation
        a. Distributed Ledger Technology
            - Decentralized system for exchange of value
            - Asset, represents value that is tangible or intangible
            - Each node maintains a copy of the DL
            - Every time a transaction occurs. all DL are updated
            - Challenges
                - Maintaining consistency
                - Privacy
                - Standardization, Interperability, and Scalability

            - DLT for the Business
            - Public would be Ethereum or Bitcoin
        b. Important Characteristics
            - Permissioned Network
                - Restricts who can access and do what on the network
                - Requires known participants, access control lists
                - Transaction validations
            - Confidential Transactions
                - Participants in control of visibility of transactions
                - Private channels can be created with limited visibility
            - No cryptocurrency
                - No need to incentivise the network for validations
                - Participants decide the who and how of validation
            - Programmablle
                - Chaincode = Smart Contract
                - Chaincode automates the business process
        c. Assets
            - Anything of value
            - Transactions = change of assets state
        d. Chaincode
            - Describes the structure of the asset, JSON or binary
            - Contains transaction business logic
        e. Ledger
            - Tracks all of the asset transactions
            - All participants have a copy of the ledger
        f. Permissioned Network
            - All identities are know
            - Membership Service Provider (1 or more)
                - Creating valid participants with certificates
            - Member, legally separate entities
            - Identities are managed by way of certificates, Certification Authority X509
                - Certificate private key is used for signing transaction
                - Even infrastructure components are assigned identity
            - Members can manage identitie within their organization
        g. Nodes and Channels
            - Node connect to other nodes to form the BC network, they use protocol to communicate
            - Node = communication entity of blockchain, require certificates
            - Participan w/Certficate -> Use App -> On Node w/Certificate
            - Types of Nodes
                - Client, application use for initiating transaction
                - Peers, keep ledgers in sync across network

            - Object oriented language for defining the domain model for the business network
        b. Model
            - Participants
            - Assets
            - Transactions
            - Events
            - file w/ .cto
            - Order
                - Declare namespace, must be globally unique
                - Resources = assets, participants, transactions, and events
            - System Namcespace
                - Default
                - Resource classes or definitions
        c. Primitive Types
            - String 
            - Double
            - Integer
            - Long
            - DateTime
            - Boolean
        d. Important Aspects
            - Abstract
                - abstract resource name identified by property
                - must be extended to create instances
            - Inheritance
                - new resources should be same type as ancestor
                - type name extends AncestorType
                - Multiple inheritance is not supported
            - Concept
                - a way to create or define generic classes
                - does not represent a resource
                - Group together properties and then use them
        e. Modeling Arrays

                - Manage instances of resources with unique identities (key)
                - Separate registry for each resource type
            - Relationships
                - Multiple registries of different resource types
                - Example: Participant owns some asset
                - --> decpits a relationship
                - Pointer to specific asset type
                - value is name = namespace.resourceName#resourceIdentity
            - What happens if reference is deleted?
                - Field will return a null value
        g. Field Validations
            - String validation uses regular expressions
                - regex=
            - Number validation uses range
                - range=
        g. Transactions and Events

                    - Block Seat
                    - Select Seat
                - no identified by needed
                - transaction name {}
                - Annotaions have information that connect model to code
                - Within function, use Composer API and then emit event
            - Events
                - can be received by subscriber applications

                    }
                - SELECT = mandatory, reigistry and asset type
                - Parameters, _$param-name, only primitive types

    10. Composer SDK/API Coding Transaction Processors
        a. Embedded Runtime
            - How does it work?
                - Simulates Fabric runtime
                - Before test, network application gets deployed on embedded runtime
                - Uses in-memory persistence
                - No special library
            - Unit Testing Harness
                - Creation of PeerAdmin Card, type = embedded
                - Use card store and card to create Admin COnnection object
                - Use AC to deploy model files into embedded runtime, network admin card is created
                - BusinessNetworkConnection is created
                - Unit Test use AC and BNC to test
            - Types of runtimes - Fabric w/Docker, PLayground, Embedded
        b. Queries (Transaction Processor)
            - Queries
                - Named .query(name)
                - Dynamic .buildQuery(query statements) -> qry.query(qry_returned, JSON param object)
            - Usage Scenarios
                - Batch Updates
                - Calculations
                - Consolidations
        c. Implementing Programmatic Access Control
            - Coding Access Control
                - runtime.getCurrentParticipants() -> Participant resource.getFullyQualifiedType or .getFullyQUalifiedIdentifier
                - Order
                    - get participant
                    - check if getFullyQualifiedType == "value" or check if getFullyQUalifiedIdentifier == "id"
            - Implementation
                - Programmatic - code rules in transaction processing function
                - Declarative - rules defined in Access Control Language
        d. Emitting Events & Integrating w/Systems
            - Global Functions
                - emit()
                    - emits an event defined in the transaction
                    - event is created as part of the model
                    - subscriber receives event with json object
                - getSerializer()
                    - get instnace of serializer to convert to and from json
                    - Serializer.toJson()
                    - Serializer.fromJson()
                - post()
                    - Database, Legacy Applications, Heavy Processing/Calculation, Workflow trigger
                    - Needed REST HTTP endpoint
                    - post(url, typed)
                        -typed = concept, asset, participant, transaction
                    - flow
                        - post() is invoked -> converts asset to JSON -> REST -> responds with json
    11. Front-End Application Patterns
        a. REST Server Middleware
            - FE w/ Angular, HTML, CSS, JS
            - FE connect w/ REST Server Middleware
            - FE connects to Enterprise Systems
            - REST Server must be secured and authenticated, as it communicates with Composer API
            - REST Server must be multi-user
        b   Custom Middleware
            - Custom Middleware NOT REST Server
        c. Hybrid Middleware
            - FE -> Web Application -> REST Server (Secured) -> Composer API
        d. Desktop Application
            - Installed application -> Composer API / Runtime
        e. How to decide?
            - Requirements/Needs
            - End User/Audience
